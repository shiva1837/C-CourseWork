# CPSC Coursework Portfolio – C++ Projects

## 👨‍💻 About This Repository
This repository is a curated collection of all my C++ coursework projects from my undergraduate studies in Computer and Information Sciences. These projects were developed as part of various assignments, demonstrating concepts in data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving.

## 📚 Courses Covered
- **CPSC 135 / Introduction to Programming**
- **CPSC 136 / Intermediate Programming**
- **CPSC 240 / Data Structures and Algorithms**
- **CPSC 242 / Object-Oriented Programming**
- *(More to come...)*

## 🧩 Projects Included
Each folder contains:
- Source code (`.cpp` and `.h` files)
- A `Makefile` for building the project
- Sample input/output files
- Unit tests (if applicable)
- A local `README.md` for project-specific info
